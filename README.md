## About Me 💡

Hi there! I'm **Sajad Kholqi**, a **Computer Engineer student** who's absolutely in love with **video games**, loves working on **Linux**, and has just started my journey into **Python programming**.  
Right now, I consider myself the weakest Python developer out there — but I'm determined to write some code one day that even *I* can't understand! 😉  

I'm also super interested in **Artificial Intelligence** and **Data Science**, and I'm slowly taking my first steps toward training models without crashing my laptop’s GPU 😴

## 🔧 What I Know So Far:

- 🐍 Python Programming (Beginner Level)
- 💻 Using development environments like VSCode and PyCharm
- 📚 Self-learning through courses and books
- 🐧 Working with Linux OS (with and without GUI!)
- 🎮 Playing games better than writing code (for now!)

## 🕹️ My Interests

- Love **video games**, especially strategy and RPG genres.
- Use gaming as an escape from stress and real-life problems.
- Trying to learn how to build my own digital worlds using code!
- Passionate about **Linux** — it gently tells me I’m messing up with just a few commands 😂
- Deeply curious about **Artificial Intelligence** and **Data Science** — I see data like a game where you just need to figure out the rules!
